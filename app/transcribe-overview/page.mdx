## Features 
Some of the primary features of the system include:

 * **Online Collaboration**: Invite other learners or fluent speakers to assist in the completion of your transcription.
 * **Deep Linking**: Selecting a region or issue will provide a direct link to the related item for sharing and collaboration.
 * **Expanding Language Support**: Additional language support can be added as transducers become available.
 * **Issue Flagging**: Mark problem words for easy identification later.
 * **Commenting**: Collaborate and discuss problem spots with others.
 * **Multiple formats**: Current support for many video and audio formats (and more coming soon).
 * **Access Level Control**: Private by default, share with viewers, editors, groups (coming soon) or any authenticated user.
 * **Language Database Indexing**: When transducers (spell checkers) are available, index "known words" into our [Language Database](/language-database) for future discovery.

This documentation will take you through the features to help you get transcribing right away.
