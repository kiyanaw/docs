## Support for Multiple Indigenous Languages
The kiyânaw Language Database supports the indexing of data from [transcriptions](/transcribe-overview) (and soon other sources like websites and documents) for any text that has a positive analysis using [an FST](/fst-support). 

When a [Finite State Transducer](/fst-support) is available for a language, we can incorporate the use of such so that transcribed materials can automatically become available to learners within the Language Database. As users transcribe, so long as they have an [language specified](/transcribe-features/settings#language-setting) and their transcription is [discoverable by others](/transcribe-features/settings#is-discoverable) the analyzed words will become available within the Language Database automatically.

Select the language you wish from the Language dropdown in the corner to switch to that section of the database.
