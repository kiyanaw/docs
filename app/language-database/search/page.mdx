## Searching the Database
From the [main page](https://bundle.kiyanaw.net/database) you will see the search bar. From here you have a few options for how you may search for text within the database including full- and partial-word searches. 


| Search type | Operator | Example | Matches |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Single word | | `example` | `example` |
| Multi-word | | `some example` | `some example` |
| Partial word | `*foo`, `foo*` | `exam*` | `example`, `exams` |
| Inter word | `f*o` | `ex*e` | `examine`, `excite` |
