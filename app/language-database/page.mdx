# Language Database

The **kiyânaw Language Database** is a repository of encountered words for any given language where learners can search and listen to fluent speakers, diving deeper into specific phrases and commentaries for immersive learning and study.

## Down the Rabbit-hole
Since languages are often complex and nuanced, there can be terms or phrases that are hard to "locate", meaning they might not be often or frequently heard in everyday speech, but still occasionally come up during a telling of a story or narrative. As learners we're often clinging onto a word or two when someone is speaking the language we're trying to learn, and these small details and nuances can often be missed, especially if the speaker becomes animated which often happens in a funny or exciting moment. 

The Language Database is designed to complement [transcription](/transcribe-overview) and support those moments when you are trying to find the correct pronunciation of a word form, study usage of a particular phrase, or maybe [search](/language-database/search) for something uncommon.
