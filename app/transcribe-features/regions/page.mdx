# Editing Regions

Regions (also sometimes called segments or sections) of a transcription represent a small section of audio or time within an overall transcription. Each region has a start and end time and can contain text for the target language as well as a translation (generally in English).

## Creating a Region

To create a region, simply drag with your mouse along the timeline:

![Create a Region](/create-region.png)

A corresponding Region will be created in the Region List on the right side:

## Playback a Region

Clicking either the region play button (in the region buttons panel) or the Region in the Region list will play the region from the start to the end. This can be useful when transcribing to hear the speaker over and over again.

## Linking to a Region

It can be useful to send the direct link of a Region to a collaborator. Click on the target Region in the region list and the URL of the browser will change to that region directly. You can now copy this URL and send it to someone.
