## Conflict Resolution

By default conflicts will attempt to resolve automatically, however if a conflict cannot be dealt with automatically, you will be presented with a dialog showing both the local and remote change, where you can choose to keep your local changes (overwrite remote change) or accept the incoming change from the remote user.
