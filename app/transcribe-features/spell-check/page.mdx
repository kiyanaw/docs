# Spell-checking for Indigenous Languages

Though generally under-represented, there are [some spell-checkers available for Indigenous Languages](https://github.com/giellalt). This generally comes from the [intensive](https://altlab.ualberta.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Snoek_et_al_CEL1_2014.pdf) and [painstaking work](https://altlab.ualberta.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Schmirler-GP1-Plains_Cree_CG-2017.pdf) of modelling the grammar or morphology of a language.

When available, the resulting application (known as an FST or [finite-state transducer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_transducer)) can be used to determine if a given word or occurence is "correct". While FSTs are capable of much more than this, for now we simply use them (when available) for the task of spell-checking, and soon to also [index known, good words from a transcription in our database](/language-database) for discovery by future learners.

## Getting your FST or Spell-checker into Transcribe

If you are the developer of an FST or spell-checker for a language that we don't currently support, [please reach out to us](mailto:support@kiyanaw.net) so we can arrange to incorporate your work for the benefit of future learners.
