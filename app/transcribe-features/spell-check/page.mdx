# Spell-checking for Indigenous Languages

Though generally under-represented, there are [some spell-checkers available for Indigenous Languages](https://github.com/giellalt). This generally comes from the [intensive](https://altlab.ualberta.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Snoek_et_al_CEL1_2014.pdf) and [painstaking work](https://altlab.ualberta.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Schmirler-GP1-Plains_Cree_CG-2017.pdf) of modelling the grammar or morphology of a language.

When available, the resulting utility (known as an FST or [finite-state transducer](/fst-support)) can be used to determine if a given word or occurence is "correct". While FSTs are capable of much more than this, for now we simply use them (when available) for the task of spell-checking, and also [index known, good words from a transcription in our database](/language-database) for discovery by future learners.

## Disambiguating Analyses 
Quite often a written form of a word may have multiple analyses available. When this is the case any words with multiple analyses will show a light-blue line beneath indicating that the analysis is ambiguous.

Clicking within the word will reveal available analyses in the [region context bar](/transcribe-features/interface-controls) where you can select the desired analysis for that word.

If you are unsure about the analysis feel free to leave it for later.

## Spelling Suggestions
When available (depending on the [FST](/fst-support)) we also provide spelling suggestions by showing a light-orange line beneath a word that has suggestions available. Clicking within the word will reveal the suggestions in the region context bar.

## Currently-supported Languages

We currently support the following FST integrations for kiyânaw Transcribe:

 * [nêhiyawêwin (Plains Cree Y-dialect `crk`)](/fst-support/crk)
 * [Northern Michif (experimental `crgn`)](/fst-support/crgn)
 * [Anishnaabemowin (Border Lakes Ojibwe `ciw`)](/fst-support/ciw)
 * [Nishnaabemowin (Odawa `otw`)]((/fst-support/otw))

## Getting your FST or Spell-checker into Transcribe

If you are the developer of an FST or spell-checker for a language that we don't currently support, [please reach out to us](mailto:support@kiyanaw.net) so we can arrange to incorporate your work for the benefit of future learners.
