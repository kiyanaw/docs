# Video Controls

When transcribing, it can be useful to view the original video, especially in a problematic spot within the recording. 

## Adjusting Size & Position

By default, the video will show up in the bottom-right corner of your window, but the position and size can be adjusted using the video controls.

### Position Controls

 * **Left arrow** (`←`) will position the video on the left-bottom corner of the screen.
 * **Circle** (`o`) will enlarge the video in the display. Clicking the video will play the currently-selected region. Click below the video to return to the smaller size.
 * **Right arrow** (`→`) will position the video on the right-bottom corner of the screen.

### Size Controls

* **Inward arrows** (`→ ←`) will make the video thumbnail smaller.
* **Outward arrows** (`← →`) will make the video thumbnail larger.
* **Down arrow** (`˅`) will minimize the video, click the `Video` button to return the thumbnail.

## Full-screen Mode

When in full-screen mode, you can click on the video to play the selected region. If no region is selected, the video will play continuously. Clicking outside the video (top or bottom) will close full-screen mode.
