# Issues

Issues allow you to flag a section of text within a region that may be problematic for several reasons. We currently **support three issue types**:

 * **Needs Help**: Inaudible or challenging passage that needs additional help from a fluent speaker or advanced learner.
 * **Indexing**: Issue type to indicate that a word exists in a given dictionary but is not "spell checking" correctly. A compiled list of this type can later be sent to the team that manages the [transducer or spell-checker](/transcribe-features/spell-check).
 * **New Word**: When a user is reasonably confident that a word is spelled correctly but it is neither spell-checking or found in a given dictionary, this issue type may be used to indicate that a word may need to be added to the dictionary for the given language.

## Adding an Issue 

After **selecting a word** within the target language text editor, the Create Issue button will become activated. Click it to create a new issue.
