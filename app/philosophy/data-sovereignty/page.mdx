# Data Sovereignty

After consulting with experts in the field of Language Revitalization and Data Sovereignty, we've rewritten our platform with the intent of being ahead of the curve in regards to your data security, access, control, and possession.

This includes: 

 * All data within the system is private by default & required explicit opt-in to share with others.
 * All data access is secured by authenticated access and pre-signed, time-expiring URLs to prevent unwanted access.
 * Removal (deletion) of a transcription within our system deletes all data in our database and storage systems immediately, with the exeption of backups which expire within 7 days. Our roadmap includes modifying the backup system for immediate removal of your data (eta, Spring 2026)

It is important to us that at all times you retain control over who has access to your data, and we will continute to built with this mentality in all upcoming features.
