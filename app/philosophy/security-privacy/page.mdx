# Security & Privacy

Our platform was re-written from the ground up to implement the highest possible baseline security for your data. 

This includes:

 * All data is encrypted in-transit & at-rest using industry-standard [AES-256](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard) level encryption.
 * All transcriptions are secure & private by default and any sharing functionality is opt-in.
 * All data access requires authentication & explicit view- or edit- permissions.
 * All media access requires pre-signed, time-limited URLs by a permissions-enabled, authenticated user.
